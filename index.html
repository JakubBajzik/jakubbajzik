							<h2>About me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I graduated from <strong>Brno University of Technology</strong> with a master's degree, and completed my PhD studies at the <strong>University of Zilina</strong>. As a <strong>computer scientist</strong>, I'm bridging the gaps in multidisciplinary research by developing and applying innovative computational methods. I thrive on thinking out of the box and exploring new, unconventional ideas. Moreover, I like writing popular science blog articles and performing science outreach activities.</p>

								<h3>Joint modelling of whole genome sequence data for human height via approximate message passing</h3>

								</ul>
								<p>Recent studies suggest the presence of thousands of common genetic variant associations and hundreds of low-frequency or rare variants associated with human height. Here, we show that existing variable selection methods may fail to either select the correct genomic regions, or the appropriate genetic variants due to the complex and potentially long-distance correlation structure of whole genome sequence (WGS) data. To address this, we develop a new algorithmic paradigm based on approximate message passing, gVAMP, which we show accurately localizes associations to variants with the correct frequency and position in the DNA.</p>

								<p>Recent technological advances allow for a diverse range of genomic features to be measured within individuals or single cells, that are linked to electronic health information and patient outcomes. However, current state-of-the-art statistical methods for these data do not allow for reliable significance testing and become inefficient in large scales and high dimensions. Here, we propose a new method called gVAMPomi, based on the recently developed genomic Vector Approximate Message Passing (gVAMP) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm allowing for efficient joint inference of model parameters.</p>

								<p>Combining genome-wide association studies across genetically diverse cohorts of ancestries can potentially leverage the shared information and increase polygenic risk score portability. Current state-of-the-art cross-ancestry summary statistics methods rely on several regularized linear regressions or variational inference schemes. In this work, we first introduce sgVAMP, the novel summary statistics. Secondly, we extend sgVAMP to a multi-cohort setting, which allows for the joint estimation of shared signals across multiple ancestries.</p>

								<h3>Startup project - Sound-based monitoring of remote areas</h3>
								<ul class="icons">
									<li><a href="docs/stromonitor.pdf" class="icon fa-link"><span class="label">Link</span></a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>The goal is to create a system for monitoring remote areas (e.g., protected areas) based on the recognition of suspicious sounds (e.g., chainsaws, gunshots). The system should detect and report suspicious sounds, including the time and location of their occurrence.</p>

								<h3>Hackathon project - Green energy in remote areas</h3>
								<ul class="icons">
									<li><a href="https://sustainable-arctic.github.io" class="icon fa-link"><span class="label">Link</span></a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Our tool analyses data from orbital satellites and land measurement units to find the most suitable spot for renewable energy production. Whether you want to build data storage or find the best place for a temporary station or habitat in cold arctic lands, we’ve covered your energy needs.</p>

								<h3>Independent Channel Residual Convolutional Network for Gunshot Detection</h3>
								<ul class="icons">
									<li><a href="https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=13&Issue=4&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=108" class="icon fa-link"><span class="label">Link</span></a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Here, we propose a robust approach for dangerous sound event detection (e.g. gunshots) to improve surveillance systems. The most recent works aim to prefer the time-frequency 2-D representation of sound as input to feed convolutional neural networks. We propose Independent Channel Residual Convolutional Network architecture, which analyse three different types of audio representations in the individual channels. </p>

								<h3>Sound event detection system for DCASE 2021 challenge</h3>

								</ul>
								<p>This paper presents the systems proposal for the DCASE 2021 challenge Task 4 (Sound event detection and separation in domestic environments). The aim is to provide the event time localization timestamps in addition to event class probabilities. We propose two systems, based on convolutional neural networks and class activation mapping.</p>
